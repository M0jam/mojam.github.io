Project Overview
Vegas Gold: Royal Edition is a high-fidelity, browser-based casino simulation designed to replicate the premium atmosphere of a high-roller lounge. Built entirely with vanilla web technologies, the project creates an immersive "Dark Mode" aesthetic heavily accented with gold gradients and dynamic lighting effects. Players can experience a risk-free economy featuring persistent progression, allowing them to level up, earn virtual currency, and unlock exclusive VIP cosmetics without the need for real-money gambling.
​

Key Features
Diverse Game Library: Features five distinct minigames including Royal Slots with 3D-transformed reels, a fully interactive Blackjack table, physics-based Golden Plinko, Royal Mines, and a retention-focused Daily Wheel.
​

Persistent Progression System: Players earn XP for every action, leveling up to unlock new gameplay features and status indicators. User data, including balance (V currency), level, and inventory, is automatically saved via the browser's localStorage.
​

Dynamic Economy & Shop: Includes a dual-market system: a standard Shop for gameplay perks (e.g., "Refund Insurance," "Lucky Charm") and an exclusive VIP Boutique for cosmetic upgrades like custom backgrounds (e.g., "Midnight Gold") and profile frames.
​

Rich Visual Effects: Utilizes advanced CSS3 3D transforms for card flips and machine animations, alongside an HTML5 Canvas particle system that renders falling 3D money bills and gold sparkles for a lively casino atmosphere.
​

Technical Highlights
Zero Dependencies: The entire application is contained within a single HTML structure, utilizing vanilla JavaScript and CSS3 without external frameworks like React or Vue.
​

Performance Optimization: Heavy visual effects, such as the "Money Rain," use pre-rendered canvas elements and requestAnimationFrame loops to maintain high frame rates.
​

Responsive Design: The interface employs a fluid grid layout and media queries to adapt the "Royal" interface seamlessly across desktop and mobile viewports.
